# TanamTepat: Soil Type Detection and Crop Recommendation üå±

This is an interactive web application built with Streamlit and TensorFlow to assist farmers and agricultural enthusiasts. By simply uploading an image of soil, the application will classify its type and provide recommendations for the most suitable crops to plant.

## ‚ú® Key Features

  - **Automatic Detection:** Identifies the soil type from an uploaded image (`Alluvial Soil`, `Black Soil`, `Clay Soil`, or `Red Soil`).
  - **Crop Recommendations:** Provides a list of crops that are best suited for the detected soil type.
  - **Simple User Interface:** The application is easy to use with a clean and minimalist interface.

## üöÄ How It Works

The application operates in a few simple steps:

1.  **Image Upload:** The user uploads a soil image through the Streamlit interface.
2.  **Model Download:** The application automatically downloads the model file (`Model_Fix.h5`) from a GitHub URL. This file is only downloaded once when the app is first run.
3.  **Image Preprocessing:** The uploaded image is resized to **224x224** pixels and normalized to be processed by the model.
4.  **Prediction:** The preprocessed image is fed into the **TensorFlow** model to predict the soil type.
5.  **Recommendation:** Based on the prediction result, the application displays a predefined list of crops suitable for that soil type.
